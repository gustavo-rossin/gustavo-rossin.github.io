    <p>My girlfriend took this picture. It was on a bar that we went to celebrate her friend's approval on public service. <br>
    I was wearing an Adidas hoodie and a black pants. I really enjoyed this picture because of the hat on the statue.</p>
    <br><p id="Skill">I have acquired many skills during these years and mainly in college.</p>
        <h2>The skills that i use at work:</h2>
<ol>
    <li>Empathy</li>
    <li>Excellent listener</li>
    <li>Calm and Respectful</li>
    <li>Excel</li>
    <li>MySQL</li>
    <li>Python</li>
    <li>Powerpoint</li>
</ol>
<p>I put the <strong>SOFTSKILLS</strong> upfront because, for me, they are the most important skills. The <strong>HARDSKILLS</strong> are also important, <br> 
    but we can always learn a new hardskill and be good at it after a lot of training. </p>
